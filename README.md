# <John's-Study-Guide>

## Description

I have put together, both for my own personal and professional development and as a show of my willingness to learn, a study guide that expresses what I have learned both through its content and very form itself.

- I was motivated to create this project because of the highly instructive manner in which its actual creation could help me attain the boilerplate skills needed to become adept at coding.
- I created this project as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that I was able to obtain these capabilities.
- The project serves as both a declaration of modest achievment and as a tool I can use to catalogue information that I find useful throughout my studies.
- Over the course of developing this project, I learned how to structure a web page with HTML, comprehensively design its elements fluidly with CSS, implement dynamic elements with JavaScript, and maintain a safe and secure workflow by using Git.
